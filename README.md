## Description

I am sure we all need some kind of help to keep track of our earnings and spendings so we don't go over our budget. That's the whole idea and motivation behind my newly released app, Budget Tracker. This full stack app is using MongoDB cloud database service to store and retrieve your entered deposits and expenses and you can always see your remaining balance on the top. Another great feature of Budget Tracker is that even if you loose your internet connection while you are using the app or even start the app with no internet connection it will function as it is supposed to and send your data to the server as soon as you are back online! That's a magic, isn't it? There is another feature I like to mention here, this app can be installed on your computer or mobile device so it is only a click away from you to keep track of your financial stuff!
